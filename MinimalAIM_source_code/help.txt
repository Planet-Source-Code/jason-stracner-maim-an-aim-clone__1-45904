::add_buddy tip::
add_buddy does not permanently add that buddy to your config list.  To add 
the buddy permanently you must use the set_config command.  A good 
It took me a
little while to figure that out so I thought I would pass it along.
To add a buddy permanently you can copy the info that comes back in the
CONFIG: server message and send it back as a paramteter in the set_config
command.  Something like "set_config {m 1{\010}g buddies{\010}b mybuddy{\010}}".


::Starting MAIM in invisable mode::
If you want to start in a deny-all mode so that no one can see when you
go online you can enter a little tag after your username.  Just enter
" hideme" after your name; like "MyUsername hideme".  This will send an
add_permit command before you shown in your buddies lists.  So they will
not see you.

::Additional Commands::
(these are just for this program and not part of the protocol)
signoff
cls

::Extra long commands::
I didn't know this when I chose to use the compobox for an input control
but it seems that is will only hold 255 characters.  Sometimes this is
not enough space for some commands (like set_config).  So I came up
with a little work around to get by this limit.  So when you you run out 
of room in the inputbox you can press ctrl+shift+L and get a new window 
to type in longer commands.  You can send command up to 2kb in length using 
this window. 2kb is the max alowed in the toc protocol.

:Copy past tips:
Anything you highlight on the message screen or the help screen is automatically
copied to the clipboard.

::Explanation of MAIM messages::
For each message on the message screen the first numbers are the time stamp.
2003.05.07-12:20:25:95 means the message was sent or received on 05/07/2003 
at 12:20:25:95.
After that if a line starts with >>> then this is data that sent from us
to the server.  If <<< then it was sent from the server.
If the line begins with "EXPLANATION:" then this is a line that is just an 
explanation of the data that was received from the server; a sort of human 
readable interpretation of the data to help you understand what the server
is trying to tell you.

::Data Purity::
A lot of care has been taken to preserve the data that is sent and received 
in order to let you see exactly what was sent and received.  The true first
character that is received from the server in each transmition is always
the '*' character.  I put the date and the "<<<: : in myself to help you 
understand what the line means.  For outgoing messages everything after the 
">>>: " is the true data.  This is important because this project is meant
to allow you to see all of what is going on behind the scenes.  Also, only
lines that start with >>>: or <<<: are the true data that is being transmitted.

::Ignoring "Keep Alive" messages::
I have added code to ignore the displaying of 'keep alive' messages that
are sent from the server.  These messages got to be too distracting when
you are trying to read the data.  They are sent from the server every minute
to check to see if we are still connected.  Here is a typical keep alive
message:  *{\005,033,142,000,004}{\000}{\000}{\000}2

::Escapes::
Some characters that are transmitted are not meant to be viewed as plain text.
Some of it is data that is meant to be interpreted as numbers.  So on the screen
I have converted these characters into their respective ASCII numbers.  For
example the letter A would look like {\065}.  For a series of these types of
characters I have separated them with commas.  Like: ABCD would be 
{\065,066,067,068}.
You can also enter these escape codes into your input.  This is handy for sending
the set_config command.  Remember that when sending these they can only be in 
the form {\010} and not {\10} or {\010,013,099}.

::Leaving off the "toc_"::
All of the commands that you can send to the server start with the letters "toc_".
In order to save you keystrokes I simply append these characters at the time of
transmitting the data.  I am letting you know this so that when you are reading the 
TOC 
protocol documentation below you will understand why you don't have to type
"toc_".

Reserved.

Version: TOC1.0

This document describes the protocol between TOC and TOC clients.
The protocol is built on TCP.  Framing is done by SFLAP,
described at the bottom of this document.  Inside each
SFLAP frame is a TOC command.

The TOC protocol is ASCII based, and special attention
must be placed argument separation.  The separator and 
the rules of separation are different for messages inbound 
to TOC and outbound to the client.  The rules of separation
are described in sections below.

The TOC server is built mainly to service the TIC and TiK clients.  Since
the TIC client is a Java applet, and downloadable, TOC will NOT support
multiple TOC protocol versions at the same time.   Therefore, TiK
users will be forced to upgrade if the protocol version changes.  
TOC sends down the protocol version it expects the client
to speak and understand.  Note, the protocol version is a string.

Important Notes
===============
* TOC will drop the connection if a command exceeds the maximum
  length, which is currently 2048 bytes.  So the client needs to 
  spend special attention to im, chat, and config message lengths.
  There is an 8k length maximum from TOC to the client.

* No commands should be sent to TOC (besides toc_signon) before 
  a SIGN_ON is received.  If you do send a command before SIGN_ON
  the command will be ignored, and in some case the connection
  will be dropped.

* Initial permit/deny items should be sent after receiving SIGN_ON 
  but before sending toc_init_done, otherwise the user will flash
  on peoples buddylist who the user has denied.  You will probably
  want to send the toc_add_buddies at this time also.

* After TOC sends the PAUSE message to a client, all messages sent 
  to TOC will be ignored, and in some cases the connection will 
  be dropped.  Another SIGN_ON message will be sent to the client 
  when it is online again.  The buddy list and permit/deny items must 
  be sent again, followed by the toc_init_done.  In most cases the 
  SIGN_ON message will be sent between 1-2 seconds after the 
  PAUSE message.  Therefore a client could choose to ignore the 
  PAUSE message and hope nothing bad happens.


Client -> TOC
==============
The commands and the arguments are usually separated by whitespaces.  
Arguments
with whitespace characters should be enclosed in quotes.  Dollar signs, 
curly brackets, square brackets, parentheses, quotes, and backslashes 
must all be backslashed whether in quotes or not.  It is usually 
a good idea just to use quotes no matter what.  All user names from clients 
to TOC should be normalized (spaces removed and lowercased), and therefore
are the one exception to the always use quotes rule.

When sending commands to the server you will not get a response
back confirming that the command format was correct or not!  However
in some cases if the command format was incorrect the connection
will be dropped.


RoastingString="Tic/Toc"

toc_signon <authorizer host> <authorizer port> <User Name> <Password> 
           <language> <version>
    The password needs to be roasted with the Roasting String if
    coming over a FLAP connection, CP connections don't use
    roasted passwords.  The language specified will be used
    when generating web pages, such as the get info pages.
    Currently the only supported language is "english".
    If the language sent isn't found, the default "english"
    language will be used.  The version string will be used
    for the client identity, and must be less then 50
    characters.

    Passwords are roasted when sent to the host.  This is done so they 
    aren't sent in "clear text" over the wire, although they are still 
    trivial to decode.  Roasting is performed by first xoring each byte 
    in the password with the equivalent modulo byte in the roasting 
    string.  The result is then converted to ascii hex, and prepended 
    with "0x".  So for example the password "password" roasts to 
    "0x2408105c23001130"

toc_init_done
    Tells TOC that we are ready to go online.  TOC clients should first 
    send TOC the buddy list and any permit/deny lists.  However toc_init_done
    must be called within 30 seconds after toc_signon, or the connection
    will be dropped.  Remember, it can't be called until after the SIGN_ON
    message is received.  Calling this before or multiple times after a
    SIGN_ON will cause the connection to be dropped.

toc_send_im <Destination User> <Message> [auto]
    Send a message to a remote user.  Remember to quote and encode the 
    message.  If the optional string "auto" is the last argument, then the 
    auto response flag will be turned on for the im. 

toc_add_buddy <Buddy User 1> [<Buddy User2> [<Buddy User 3> [...]]]
    Add buddies to your buddy list.  This does not change your
    saved config.

toc_remove_buddy <Buddy User 1> [<Buddy User2> [<Buddy User 3> [...]]]
    Remove buddies from your buddy list.  This does not change your
    saved config.

toc_set_config <Config Info>
    Set the config information for this user.  The config information
    is line oriented with the first character being the item type,
    followed by a space, with the rest of the line being the item
    value.  Only letters, numbers, and spaces should be used.  Remember
    you will have to enclose the entire config in quotes.

    Item Types:
    g - Buddy Group (All Buddies until the next g or the end of config 
		     are in this group.)
    b - A Buddy 
    p - Person on permit list
    d - Person on deny list
    m - Permit/Deny Mode.  Possible values are
	1 - Permit All
	2 - Deny All
	3 - Permit Some
	4 - Deny Some

toc_evil <User> <norm|anon>
    Evil/Warn someone else.  The 2nd argument is either the string
    "norm" for a normal warning, or "anon" for an anonymous 
    warning.  You can only evil people who have recently sent you
    ims.  The higher someone's evil level, the slower they can
    send message.

toc_add_permit [ <User 1> [<User 2> [...]]]
    ADD the following people to your permit mode.  If
    you are in deny mode it will switch you to permit
    mode first.  With no arguments and in deny mode
    this will switch you to permit none. If already
    in permit mode, no arguments does nothing
    and your permit list remains the same.

toc_add_deny [ <User 1> [<User 2> [...]]]
    ADD the following people to your deny mode. If
    you are in permit mode it will switch you to
    deny mode first.  With no arguments and in permit
    mode, this will switch you to deny none. If
    already in deny mode, no arguments does nothing
    and your deny list remains unchanged.

toc_chat_join <Exchange> <Chat Room Name>
    Join a chat room in the given exchange.  Exchange is
    an integer that represents a group of chat rooms.
    Different exchanges have different properties.  For
    example some exchanges might have room replication (ie
    a room never fills up, there are just multiple
    instances.) and some exchanges might have navigational
    information, and some exchanges might have ...  Currently
    exchange should always be 4, however this may
    change in the future.  You will either
    receive an ERROR if the room couldn't be joined
    or a CHAT_JOIN message.  The Chat Room Name
    is case insensitive and consecutive spaces
    are removed.

toc_chat_send <Chat Room ID> <Message>
    Send a message in a chat room using the chat room
    id from CHAT_JOIN.  Since reflection is always on in
    TOC, you do not need to add the message to your chat UI,
    since you will get a CHAT_IN with the message.  
    Remember to quote and encode the message.

toc_chat_whisper <Chat Room ID> <dst_user> <Message>
    Send a message in a chat room using the chat room
    id from CHAT_JOIN.  This message is directed at
    only one person.  (Currently you DO need to add this to
    your UI.)  Remember to quote and encode the message.  
    Chat whispering is different from IMs since it is linked
    to a chat room, and should usually be displayed in the chat
    room UI.

toc_chat_evil <Chat Room ID> <User> <norm|anon>
    Evil/Warn someone else inside a chat room.  The 3rd argument is either 
    the string "norm" for a normal warning, or "anon" for an anonymous 
    warning.  Currently chat evil is not turned on in the chat complex.

toc_chat_invite <Chat Room ID> <Invite Msg> <buddy1> [<buddy2> [<buddy3> [...]]]
    Once you are inside a chat room you can invite other people into
    that room.  Remember to quote and encode the invite message.

toc_chat_leave <Chat Room ID>
    Leave the chat room.

toc_chat_accept <Chat Room ID>
    Accept a CHAT_INVITE message from TOC.  The server will send a
    CHAT_JOIN in response.

toc_get_info <username>
    Gets a user's info a GOTO_URL or ERROR message will be sent back to the 
    client.

toc_set_info <info information>
    Set the LOCATE user information.  This is basic HTML.
    Remember to encode the info.

toc_set_away [<away message>]
    if the away message is present, then the unavailable
    status flag is set for the user.  If the away message
    is not present, then the unavailable status flag is
    unset.  The away message is basic HTML, remember to
    encode the information.

toc_get_dir <username>
    Gets a user's dir info a GOTO_URL or ERROR message will be sent back to 
    the client.

toc_set_dir <info information>
    Set the DIR user information.  This is a colon separated fields as in:
    "first name":"middle name":"last name":"maiden name":"city":"state":
    "country":"email":"allow web earches"
    Should return a DIR_STATUS msg.  Having anything in the "allow web 
    searches" field allows people to use web-searches to find your directory 
    info. Otherwise, they'd have to use the client.  

toc_dir_search <info information>
    Perform a search of the Oscar Directory, using colon separated fields 
    as in:
    "first name":"middle name":"last name":"maiden name":"city":"state":
    "country":"email"
    Returns either a GOTO_URL or ERROR msg.  

toc_set_idle <idle secs>
    Set idle information. If <idle secs> is 0 then the user isn't idle at 
    all.
    If <idle secs> is greater then 0 then the user has already been idle
    for <idle secs> number of seconds.  The server will automatically
    keep incrementing this number, so do not repeatedly call with new
    idle times.

toc_set_caps [ <Capability 1> [<Capability 2> [...]]]
    Set my capabilities.  All capabilities that we support need to
    be sent at the same time.  Capabilities are represented by
    UUIDs.  

toc_rvous_propose  - Not Implemented Yet

toc_rvous_accept <nick> <cookie> <service> <tlvlist>
    Accept a rendezvous proposal from the user <nick>.
    <cookie> is the cookie from the RVOUS_PROPOSE
    message.  <service> is the UUID the proposal was
    for. <tlvlist> contains a list of tlv tags followed by
    base64 encoded values.

toc_rvous_cancel <nick> <cookie> <service> <tlvlist>
    Cancel a rendezvous proposal from the user <nick>.
    <cookie> is the cookie from the RVOUS_PROPOSE
    message.  <service> is the UUID the proposal was
    for. <tlvlist> contains a list of tlv tags followed by
    base64 encoded values.

toc_format_nickname <new_format>
    Reformat a user's nickname.  An ADMIN_NICK_STATUS or ERROR message will 
    be sent back to the client.

toc_change_passwd <existing_passwd new_passwd>
    Change a user's password.  An ADMIN_PASSWD_STATUS or ERROR message will 
    be sent back to the client.


TOC -> Client
==============
All user names from TOC to client are NOT normalized, and are
sent as they should be displayed.  String are NOT encoded, instead
we use colons as separators.  So that you can have colons inside
of messages, everything after the colon before :<Message> should
be considered part of the message (ie don't just "split" on colons,
instead split with a max number of results.)


SIGN_ON:<Client Version Supported>
   This is sent after a successful toc_signon command is sent to TOC.
   If the command was unsuccessful either the FLAP connection will
   be dropped or you will receive a ERROR message.

CONFIG:<config>
   A user's config. Config can be empty in which case the host was not able 
   to retrieve it, or a config didn't exist for the user.  See 
   toc_set_config above for the format.

NICK:<Nickname>
   Tells you your correct nickname (ie how it should be capitalized and
   spacing)

IM_IN:<Source User>:<Auto Response T/F?>:<Message>
   Receive an IM from some one.  Everything after the third colon is
   the incoming message, including other colons.

UPDATE_BUDDY:<Buddy User>:<Online? T/F>:<Evil Amount>:<Signon Time>:<IdleTime>:<UC>
   This one command handles arrival/depart/updates.  Evil Amount is
   a percentage, Signon Time is UNIX epoc, idle time is in minutes, 
   UC (User Class)
   is a two/three character string.
   uc[0]:
   ' '  - Ignore
   'A'  - On AOL
   uc[1]
   ' '  - Ignore
   'A'  - Oscar Admin
   'U'  - Oscar Unconfirmed
   'O'  - Oscar Normal
   uc[2] 
   '\0' - Ignore
   ' '  - Ignore
   'U'  - The user has set their unavailable flag.

EVILED:<new evil>:<name of eviler, blank if anonymous>
   The user was just eviled.

CHAT_JOIN:<Chat Room Id>:<Chat Room Name>
   We were able to join this chat room.  The Chat Room Id is
   internal to TOC.

CHAT_IN:<Chat Room Id>:<Source User>:<Whisper? T/F>:<Message>
   A chat message was sent in a chat room.

CHAT_UPDATE_BUDDY:<Chat Room Id>:<Inside? T/F>:<User 1>:<User 2>...
   This one command handles arrival/departs from a chat room.  The
   very first message of this type for each chat room contains the
   users already in the room.

CHAT_INVITE:<Chat Room Name>:<Chat Room Id>:<Invite Sender>:<Message>
   We are being invited to a chat room.

CHAT_LEFT:<Chat Room Id>

   <Return Code> is always 0 for success status.

ADMIN_NICK_STATUS:<Return Code>:<Optional args>
   <Return Code> is always 0 for success status.

ADMIN_PASSWD_STATUS:<Return Code>:<Optional args>
   <Return Code> is always 0 for success status.

   Tells TIC to pause so we can do migration

RVOUS_PROPOSE:<user>:<uuid>:<cookie>:<seq>:<rip>:<pip>:<vip>:<port>
              [:tlv tag1:tlv value1[:tlv tag2:tlv value2[:...]]]
   Another user has proposed that we rendezvous with them to
   perform the service specified by <uuid>.  They want us
   to connect to them, we have their rendezvous ip, their 
   proposer_ip, and their verified_ip. The tlv values are 
   base64 encoded.

Typical Signon Process
======================
Except for the section marked optional this is an sequential
process.  Each line MUST occur before the following line.

* Client connects to TOC
* Client sends "FLAPON\r\n\r\n"
* TOC sends Client FLAP SIGNON
* Client sends TOC FLAP SIGNON
* Client sends TOC "toc_signon" message
* if login fails TOC drops client's connection
  else TOC sends client SIGN_ON reply
* if Client doesn't support version it drops the connection

[BEGIN OPTIONAL]
    * TOC sends Client CONFIG
    * Client sends TOC permit/deny stuff
    * Client sends TOC toc_add_buddy message
[END OPTIONAL]

* Client sends TOC toc_init_done message


SFLAP Documentation
===================
SFLAP is pretty much a FLAP connection except the DATA frame payload is a 
null
terminated string when traveling from client to host, it is NOT null
terminated when traveling from host to client.  The FLAP Header is binary 
data, and is in network byte order.  The data portion is at offset 6, after 
the
header.  The sequence number is sequential in each direction.  So
packets from the server to client have one sequence number, while
the packets from the client to server have an independent
increasing number.

FLAP Header (6 bytes)
-----------
Offset   Size  Type
0        1     ASTERISK (literal ASCII '*')
1        1     Frame Type
2        2     Sequence Number
4        2     Data Length


Valid Frame Type Values
-----------------------
1   SIGNON
2   DATA
3   ERROR     (Not used by TOC)
4   SIGNOFF   (Not used by TOC)
5   KEEP_ALIVE


TOC SIGNON FRAME TYPE
---------------------
Sequence Number contains the initial sequence number used in each direction.
Data Length contains the payload length, with the payload described
below.  The payload area is NOT null terminated.

Host To Client:
    4 byte FLAP version (1)

Client To Host:  
    4 byte FLAP version (1)
    2 byte TLV Tag (1)
    2 byte Normalized User Name Length
    N byte Normalized User Name  (NOT null terminated)

    
TOC DATA FRAME TYPE
-------------------
Sequence Number contains the next sequence number.
Data Length is the length of the payload, including the null termination
from client to host.
